# Sand Engine

This is a sand engine wrtten using straight C with OpenGL support libs GLFW and GLEW. You can test out the engine downloading the zip archive or build the project by your own.

# Links to the resources

This engine is just another Cellular Automata. I've been inspired to code my own SandBox by John Jackson's cool [introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZjd_Y1gJ8&t=498s) to sand games and one of my favourite rougelike games called Noita, by the way here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prXuyMCgbTc) to the GDC talk about how the sand works there. Also here is a very helpfull [article](https://maxbittker.com/making-sandspiel/) about this amazing topic.
